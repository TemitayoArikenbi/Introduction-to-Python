The area where the most striking evidence for the influence of language on
thought has come to light is the language of space — how we describe the
orientation of the world around us. Suppose you want to give someone directions
for getting to your house. You might say: “After the traffic lights, take the first
left, then the second right, and then you’ll see a white house in front of you. Our
door is on the right.” But in theory, you could also say: “After the traffic lights,
drive north, and then on the second crossing drive east, and you’ll see a white
house directly to the east. Ours is the southern door.” These two sets of directions
may describe the same route, but they rely on different systems of coordinates.
The first uses egocentric coordinates, which depend on our own bodies: a leftright
axis and a front-back axis orthogonal to it. The second system uses fixed
geographic directions, which do not rotate with us wherever we turn.
We find it useful to use geographic directions when hiking in the open
countryside, for example, but the egocentric coordinates completely dominate our
speech when we describe small-scale spaces. We don’t say: “When you get out of
the elevator, walk south, and then take the second door to the east.” The reason
the egocentric system is so dominant in our language is that it feels so much easier
and more natural. After all, we always know where “behind” or “in front of” us
is. We don’t need a map or a compass to work it out, we just feel it, because the
egocentric coordinates are based directly on our own bodies and our immediate
visual fields.
But then a remote Australian aboriginal tongue, Guugu Yimithirr, from north
Queensland, turned up, and with it came the astounding realization that not all
languages conform to what we have always taken as simply “natural.” In fact,
Guugu Yimithirr doesn’t make any use of egocentric coordinates at all. The
anthropologist John Haviland and later the linguist Stephen Levinson have shown
that Guugu Yimithirr does not use words like “left” or “right,” “in front of” or
“behind,” to describe the position of objects. Whenever we would use the
egocentric system, the Guugu Yimithirr rely on cardinal directions. If they want
you to move over on the car seat to make room, they’ll say “move a bit to the
east.” To tell you where exactly they left something in your house, they’ll say, “I
left it on the southern edge of the western table.” Or they would warn you to
“look out for that big ant just north of your foot.” Even when shown a film on
television, they gave descriptions of it based on the orientation of the screen. If
the television was facing north, and a man on the screen was approaching, they
said that he was “coming northward.”
When these peculiarities of Guugu Yimithirr were uncovered, they inspired a
large-scale research project into the language of space. And as it happens, Guugu
Yimithirr is not a freak occurrence; languages that rely primarily on geographical
coordinates are scattered around the world, from Polynesia to Mexico, from
Namibia to Bali. For us, it might seem the height of absurdity for a dance teacher
to say, “Now raise your north hand and move your south leg eastward.” But the
joke would be lost on some: the Canadian-American musicologist Colin McPhee,
who spent several years on Bali in the 1930s, recalls a young boy who showed
great talent for dancing. As there was no instructor in the child’s village, McPhee
arranged for him to stay with a teacher in a different village. But when he came to
check on the boy’s progress after a few days, he found the boy dejected and the
teacher exasperated. It was impossible to teach the boy anything, because he
simply did not understand any of the instructions. When told to take “three steps
east” or “bend southwest,” he didn’t know what to do. The boy would not have
had the least trouble with these directions in his own village, but because the
landscape in the new village was entirely unfamiliar, he became disoriented and
confused. Why didn’t the teacher use different instructions? He would probably
have replied that saying “take three steps forward” or “bend backward” would be
the height of absurdity.
So different languages certainly make us speak about space in very different ways.
But does this necessarily mean that we have to think about space differently? By
now red lights should be flashing, because even if a language doesn’t have a word
for “behind,” this doesn’t necessarily mean that its speakers wouldn’t be able to
understand this concept. Instead, we should look for the possible consequences of
what geographic languages oblige their speakers to convey. In particular, we
should be on the lookout for what habits of mind might develop because of the
necessity of specifying geographic directions all the time.
In order to speak a language like Guugu Yimithirr, you need to know where the
cardinal directions are at each and every moment of your waking life. You need to
have a compass in your mind that operates all the time, day and night, without
lunch breaks or weekends off, since otherwise you would not be able to impart the
most basic information or understand what people around you are saying. Indeed,
speakers of geographic languages seem to have an almost-superhuman sense of
orientation. Regardless of visibility conditions, regardless of whether they are in
thick forest or on an open plain, whether outside or indoors or even in caves,
whether stationary or moving, they have a spot-on sense of direction. They don’t
look at the sun and pause for a moment of calculation before they say, “There’s an
ant just north of your foot.” They simply feel where north, south, west and east
are, just as people with perfect pitch feel what each note is without having to
calculate intervals. There is a wealth of stories about what to us may seem like
incredible feats of orientation but for speakers of geographic languages are just a
matter of course. One report relates how a speaker of Tzeltal from southern
Mexico was blindfolded and spun around more than 20 times in a darkened house.
Still blindfolded and dizzy, he pointed without hesitation at the geographic
directions.
How does this work? The convention of communicating with geographic
coordinates compels speakers from the youngest age to pay attention to the clues
from the physical environment (the position of the sun, wind and so on) every
second of their lives, and to develop an accurate memory of their own changing
orientations at any given moment. So everyday communication in a geographic
language provides the most intense imaginable drilling in geographic orientation
(it has been estimated that as much as 1 word in 10 in a normal Guugu Yimithirr
conversation is “north,” “south,” “west” or “east,” often accompanied by precise
hand gestures). This habit of constant awareness to the geographic direction is
inculcated almost from infancy: studies have shown that children in such societies
start using geographic directions as early as age 2 and fully master the system by 7
or 8. With such an early and intense drilling, the habit soon becomes second
nature, effortless and unconscious. When Guugu Yimithirr speakers were asked
how they knew where north is, they couldn’t explain it any more than you can
explain how you know where “behind” is.
